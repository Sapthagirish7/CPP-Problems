The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Logic:
if n=3,we develop the grey code like this,
for n=1 :  0 
           1
for n=2 : reverse them and keep 1 infront of them
          0 0
          0 1
          added:
          1 1
          1 0
for n=3 : reverse them and add 1
         0 0 0
         0 0 1
         0 1 1
         0 1 0
         newly added by adding 1
         1 0 0
         1 0 1
         1 1 1
         1 1 0
 and so on..for n.
 
code:
   vector<int> Solution::grayCode(int n) {
            vector<int> result(1, 0);  //[0,1]      
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int curSize = result.size();
                // push back all element in result in reverse order
                for (int j = curSize - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                    result.push_back(result[j] + (1 << i));
                } 
            }
            return result;
}
