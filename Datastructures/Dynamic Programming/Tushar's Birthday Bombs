# Problem Description

It’s Tushar’s birthday today and he has N friends.

Friends are numbered [0, 1, 2, ...., N-1] and ith friend have a positive strength B[i].

Today being his birthday, his friends have planned to give him birthday bombs (kicks).

Tushar's friends know Tushar's pain bearing limit and would hit accordingly.

If Tushar’s resistance is denoted by A (>=0) then find the lexicographically smallest order of friends to kick Tushar so that the cumulative kick strength (sum of the strengths of friends who kicks) doesn’t exceed his resistance capacity and total no. of kicks hit are maximum.

Also note that each friend can kick unlimited number of times (If a friend hits x times, his strength will be counted x times)

Return the lexicographically smallest array of maximum length where the ith index represents the index of the friend who will hit.

NOTE:

[a1, a2, ...., am] is lexicographically smaller than [b1, b2, .., bm] if a1 < b1 or (a1 = b1 and a2 < b2) ... .
Input cases are such that the length of the answer does not exceed 100000.

code:
vector<int> Solution::solve(int A, vector<int> &B) {
  int idx=min_element(B.begin(),B.end())-B.begin();
    
    int m=B[idx],l=A/m,rem=A-m*l,i=0;   //l is the max possible length(we return vec of this l)
    
    if(rem==0) return vector<int> (l,idx);  //rem is remaining value if we fill entire vec with m's
   
    vector<int> res;
    while(res.size()<l)
    {
        if((B[i]-m)<=rem)   //we are checking if any of the element before element before it can be placed in place of minimum element if it doesn't exceeds the remainder.
        {
            res.push_back(i);
            rem=rem-(B[i]-m);  // then we update the remainder and check if any more of the elemnts left. if no ones is found then answer will consist of min element only.
        }
        else i++;
    }
    return res;
    
}
