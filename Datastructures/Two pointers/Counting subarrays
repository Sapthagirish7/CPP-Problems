Problem Description

Given an array A of N non-negative numbers and you are also given non-negative number B.

You need to find the number of subarrays in A having sum less than B. We may assume that there is no overflow.


code:

int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A, int B) {
    int count=0, curSum=0;
    int i=0, j=0;
    for(int j=0; j<A.size(); j++) 
    {
       curSum += A[j]; 
        while(curSum>=B)
          curSum -= A[i++];
          count += j-i+1;
    }
    return count;
}
